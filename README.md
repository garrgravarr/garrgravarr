- 👋 Hi, I’m @garrgravarr, an old -ahem- experienced programmer, trained physicist, father trying to teach my son the beauty of code wrapped in parentheses. 
- 👀 I’m interested in anything LISP and functional programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming in Julia, because I do think Python is not the answer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on AI done in any Lisp dialect, or any educational programme to promote the use of Lisp (Scheme/Racket, CL, Clojure, etc. I am not yet convinced of HyLang, though)
- 📫 You can reach me via t1m -at- phrogstar -dot- de.
